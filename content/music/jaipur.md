### Here are a few ragas sung by stalwarts from Jaipur Atrauli Gharana which I like the most:


#### Raga Bageshri by Kishori Amonkar

Bada Khyal is the tradition *Kaun Gat Bhayi* set to madhyalaya teental

Chota Khyal is *Aeri Maai Sajan Nahi Aaye* set to madhyalaya Addha, a specialty of Tai

Although the feeling of sadness and separation is the signature of Bageshree and is very well presented in this repertoire, this Bageshree presents a new face of Bageshree.  The harkats, refrains are just heavenly. No one could have thought of such beautiful permutations of Bageshree swaras. I am speechless after listening to this perfection.
