A picture of Ustad Alladiya Khan, the establisher of this gharana.

The gharan established by Ustad Alladiya Khan has given indian classical world a battery of accomplished artists - Kesarbai Kerkar, Mogubai Kurdikar, Dhondu Tai Kulkarni, Kishori Amonkar, Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande etc.
# Here are a few ragas sung by stalwarts from Jaipur Atrauli Gharana which I like the most:


#### Raga Bageshri by Kishori Amonkar

Bada Khyal is the tradition *Kaun Gat Bhayi* set to madhyalaya teental

Chota Khyal is *Aeri Maai Sajan Nahi Aaye* set to madhyalaya Addha, a specialty of Tai.

Although the feeling of sadness and separation is the signature of Bageshree and is very well presented in this repertoire, this Bageshree presents a new face of Bageshree.  The harkats, refrains are just heavenly. No one could have thought of such beautiful permutations of Bageshree swaras. I am speechless after listening to this perfection. Notice how within the first 2 minutes (with only her swarmandal playing for more than 30 seconds), this doyenne of classical music sets up the mood of Bageshri. This Bageshri is sung by younger Kishori Tai, somewhere around when she made swarmandal her accompaniment.


#### Raga Basanti Kedar by Mallikarjun Mansur and Kesarbai Kerkar

As elaborated by Dr. Rajan Parrikar:

>The Atrauli-Jaipur Basanti Kedar retains the framework of Kedar and draws relatively 
sparingly on Basant. The latter is introduced typically at the tail end of the following 
sequence: 

>P S", NDN D P, D M, G m D m G m G r S 

>(M=shuddha and m=teevra madhyam.)

>The komal dhaivat of Basant is abandoned. Both the rishabs are employed, the komal 
as shown above is the Basanti contribution, the shuddha, for the most part, in the tAra 
saptak in Kedaric moves.

##### Mallikarjun Mansur

Bada Khyal is the traditional Alladiya khaan *cheez* Attara Sugandha Gulaal set to madhyalaya teental.

##### Kesarbai Kerkar

Bada Khyal is again the traditional Alladiya khaan *cheez* Attara Sugandha Gulaal set to madhyalaya teental.
One can determine the popularity of this raga by listening to her in the initial aalaap. She tells her audience *'...aap log sab jaante honge...basant ko jaante honge aur kedare ko bhi jaante honge..magar aaj ek aisi cheez sunaati hoon ki kedara aur basant dono mil ke saath gaaenge...aap chaahe to dono alag alag dikhaungi nahi to saath saath dikhaungi.'*
