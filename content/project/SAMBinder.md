S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is one of the essential metabolic cofactor/intermediate which is found in almost every cellular life forms and enzymes. It plays a vital role in various metabolic and regulatory pathways, mainly involved in transfer of various groups (e.g., methyl, aminopropyl, methylene). It is a second widely studied ligand after ATP. SAM is a potential drug target for many diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson, Epilepsy, Osrteoarthritis and many more. Some of the reported drug targets are Catechol O-methyltransferase, Glycine N-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-1, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme, Cystathionine beta-synthase.
